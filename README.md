Real-time online Chat app for sharing images and text messages among users

1. Server and API built using Node.js and Express.js
2. Real-time experience and unicast and broadcast messaging enabled by Socket.io
3. Persistance achieved using Moongoose and Atlas MongoDB

This app is for show casing my backend skills and hence the frontend is very simple and built using Vanilla JavaScript
